Welcome to Panpan Zhang’s personal website. I am currently an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics (tenure track) in the Department of Biostatistics and an Assistant Professor of Neurology (secondary) in the Department of Neurology at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). Besides, I am a faculty member within the Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer’s Center (VMAC), which is an NIA-funded exploratory Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) at VUMC.

Prior to joining VUMC, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (DBEI) at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania (Penn), under the supervision of Professor Sharon X. Xie. From 2016 to 2018, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Connecticut.
